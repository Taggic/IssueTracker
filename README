Intro
------ 
 Simply spoken a user can easily report an issue for defined products which will
 be added to an issue log (project). Some checks are implemented to prove if 
 most important values are given. The user will be informed by a green info box 
 if the issue was added successfully to the log file or a red one with details 
 to provide missing information. The issue will be stored to a file of issues 
 and gets an ID. Automatically the configured admin is informed by mail about a 
 new entry to the issue list. The complete issue list delivers a detailed
 overview to the admin of the reports. The admin is able to easily reduce the 
 visible information (column wise) displayed to the users, which not necessarily
 of interest by them.
 
 Members of configured 'assign' groups are able to edit the entries of the issue
 list and see the complete set of details. The issue list is sortable on all 
 columns. The email addresses of this group members are automatically loaded
 into the lists select box to be easily set as issue related contact.

Examples/Usage
--------------
 Use this plugin to simply create an issue tracking. It is a further development
 based on dokumicrobugtracker 2011-04-13  initial code base for corrections, 
 which was not working on my installation (Rincewind + Arctic). Probably you 
 noticed the same problems (e.g. edit of entries does not work) and may find a 
 help with this.

 
1. Report an issue
------------------
 This is a form shown to the user to provide controls for input of issue 
 information. Following information are handled:
 
  {{issuetracker>project=your_project|status=all|display=form}}  

  ID			          automatically set 
  Project 		      automatically set (defined by your_project, see Syntax) 
  Product 		      user can select from admin pre-defined set of values 
  Version		        user to enter version info 
  User name 		    name derived from login if registered user, else should be entered by user 
  User mail		      e-mail derived from login if registered user, else should be entered by user 
  User phone		    phonenumber of the user 
  Add contact 		  a further contact can be added if necessary 
  Severity		      user can select from admin pre-defined set of severities
  Issue Title		    the headline of the issue 
  Issue Description	user to enter the issue details 
  Symptoms		      user may add up to 3 links targeting files on a symptom server 
  Captcha		        user to enter for security reasons (if configured)


2. Issue List
-------------
 The Plugin delivers an issue list, where admin can configure a restricted view 
 for users. The admin view delivers more details in the table. Admin is able to 
 modify some entries directly on this output, i.e. admin is able to assign the 
 issue to a member of configured user-groups (see configuration). 

 {{issuetracker>project=your_project|product=all|status=all|severity=all|display=issues}} 

3. Issue Details view
--------------------- 
 For better handling and also accessible for users there is a details view of an
 issue. Therefore the Issue List containing a input and button to specify the 
 isuue ID. This will provide a new page displaying all information of an issue 
 and delivering a comment function for interaction between User and Admin/
 assigned resource. Both (user/assignee) will be informed about issue updates by
 email, if configured. 


4. General Info 
----------------
 There are multiple files created. First there is a project file containing all 
 issue information except comments. Each issue will have a related comments file
 where the communication is stored to. Additionally a status log file will 
 provide an overview when the status changed and by whom. All files are stored 
 to data/meta directory with file extension ”.issue” or ”.cmnts”.
