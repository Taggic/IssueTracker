3. Examples/Usage
------------------ 
Use this plugin to simply create an issue tracking. 
The plugin delivers a user front end to create issues: 

- ID           automatically set 
- User         e-mail derived from login if registered user, else should be entered by user 
- Project      automatically set (defined by your_project, see Syntax below) 
- Version      user can select from admin pre-defined set of values 
- Severity     user can select from admin pre-defined set of severities 
- Description  user to enter the issue details 
- Captcha      user to enter for security reasons (non-admin only)


The Plugin delivers a report showing all values to the admin but less details to a user,
depending on admins configuration: 

- ID           automatically created ID of the issue
- Status       New if just created but Admin can change this free text
- Severity     given by the user but admin is free to change it
- Created      the date when the issue was created (maybe used for reportings)
- Version      user selection from admin defined set, can be changed by admin
- User         automatically detected if user is registered or entered an email
               address to be asked for explanation or further symptoms
- Description  users description, can be modified by admin
- assigned to  admin can enter a valid email address,
               initially only admin is entered (no mail address !)
- Resolution   once the problems root cause is analysed and the correction is 
               available for download (or whatever the solution maybe) 
               it can be entered here by admin role 
- Modified     this is a field to track the last change of the issue            
               currently an admin task to insert it manually
