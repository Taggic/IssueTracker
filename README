Intro
------ 
 Simply spoken a user can easily report an issue for defined products which will be added 
 to an issue log (project). Some checks are implemented to prove if most important values 
 are given. The user will be informed by a green info box if the issue was added successfully 
 to the log file or a red one with details to provide missing information. The issue will 
 be stored to a file of issues and gets an ID. Automatically the configured admin is informed 
 by mail about a new entry to the issue list. The complete issue list delivers a detailed 
 overview to the admin of the reports. The admin is able to easily reduce the visible 
 information (column wise) displayed to the users, which not necessarily of interest by them.
 
 Members of configured 'assign'groups are able to edit the entries of the issue list and see 
 the complete set of details. The issue list is sortable on all columns. The email addresses 
 of this group members are automatically loaded into the lists select box to be easily set as 
 issue related contact.

Examples/Usage
--------------
 Use this plugin to simply create an issue tracking. It is a further development based on 
 dokumicrobugtracker 2011-04-13  initial code base for corrections, which was not working 
 on my installation (Rincewind + Arctic). Probably you noticed the same problems 
 (e.g. edit of entries does not work) and may find a help with this.
 
1. Report an issue
------------------
 This is a form shown to the user to provide controls for input of issue information. 
 Following information are handled:
 
  {{issuetracker>project=your_project|status=all|display=form}}  

  ID			automatically set 
  Project 		automatically set (defined by your_project, see Syntax) 
  Product 		user can select from admin pre-defined set of values 
  Version		user to enter version info 
  User name 		name derived from login if registered user, else should be entered by user 
  User mail		e-mail derived from login if registered user, else should be entered by user 
  User phone		phonenumber of the user 
  Add contact 		a further contact can be added if necessary 
  Severity		user can select from admin pre-defined set of severities
  Issue Title		the headline of the issue 
  Issue Description	user to enter the issue details 
  Symptoms		user may add up to 3 links targeting files on a symptom server 
  Captcha		user to enter for security reasons (if configured)


2. Issue List
-------------
 The Plugin delivers an issue list, where admin can configure a restricted view for users. 
 The admin view delivers more details in the table. Admin is able to modify some entries 
 directly on this output, i.e. admin is able to assign the issue to a member of configured 
 user-groups (see configuration). 

 {{issuetracker>project=your_project|status=all|display=issues}} 

3. Issue Details view
--------------------- 
 For better handling and also accessible for users there is a details view of an issue. Therefore 
 the Issue List containing a input and button to specify the isuue ID. This will provide a new 
 page displaying all information of an issue and delivering a comment function for interaction 
 between User and Admin/assigned resource. Both (user/assignee) will be informed about issue 
 updates by email, if configured. 


4. General Info 
----------------
 There are multiple files created. First there is a project fle containing all issue information 
 except comments. Each issue will have a related comments file where the communication is stored 
 to. All files are stored to data/meta directory with file extension ”.issue” or ”.cmnts”.
